				<h1>2023 In Review</h1>

				<p>I go to a lot of concerts. I moved to London specifically because I wanted to be a part of a bigger music scene than the one that exists in Oslo. So while I'm here I want to make use of the city as much as I can. Back in 2022, once it felt safe enough to venture outside, I started keeping track of all of the bands I saw in a playlist. This was mostly because I constantly forgot who I had or hadn't seen, but also I was curious. I ended up seeing 62 different artists, which isn't bad for the course of a year. I kept this up in 2023 and in the course of that year I saw 146 different artists, mostly smaller independent acts playing on small stages to an even smaller audience.</p>
<p>I noticed that I had gotten into a habit of seeing as much as possible, so as much as I'm successfully taking advantage of London I decided that I'd dial it back a bit in 2024. So as a way to celebrate last year's obsession I'm going to showcase some of the best new artists I've discovered this year. Note that I enjoy fast and aggressive music, so these will probably all trend towards that.</p>
<h2>Grade 2</h2>
<p>There is a promoter in London called <a href="https://www.tillthewheels.com/">Till The Wheels</a> who puts on a lot of punk and hardcore shows. I had been to many that were quite good so I got into the habit of just going to whatever show they had on when I had time. One of the shows was for <em>Grade 2</em> and I absolutely loved it! They have the kind of eponymous British punk rock sound, at least to me, and their live show was fast and fun and got pretty crazy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xggxT3efrGU"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/xggxT3efrGU/0.jpg" alt="Grade 2 - Pubwatch"></a></p>
<h2>J.O.B.</h2>
<p>This band was a completely random discovery, which is always fun. I was at a show to see a friend of mine and happened to catch <em>J.O.B</em> who blew me away. Melodic rock music with a bit of a psychedelic vibe played by incredibly skilled musicians. These guys are young and just starting out, but I'm hoping they get discovered by a label or someone who can propel them further out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki4b2Yp9by4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ki4b2Yp9by4/0.jpg" alt="J.O.B - The Powers On High"></a></p>
<h2>Moskito</h2>
<p>This wasn't as much of a discovery I personally made, but <em>Moskito</em> are a band who was managed by the former manager of one of my bands. They play tight and aggressive rock music and their songs are a good mix of catchy and quirky. They also have a very cool aesthetic in their music videos and album art.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OknE4lYwk6Y"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/OknE4lYwk6Y/0.jpg" alt="MOSKITO - Killing Joke"></a></p>
<h2>First Time Dead</h2>
<p>Another discovery via Till The Wheels. These guys sound a lot like <em>Propagandhi</em>, which is a band I very much like but have yet to see live. It's kind of traditional punk rock with a lot of nice lead guitar melodies. I saw an ad of theirs where they were looking for a new vocalist which I considered for a minute, but the vocal style isn't one I'm very good at so I never applied.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4hEMU8locg"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/f4hEMU8locg/0.jpg" alt="First Time Dead - Mediterranean Tears"></a></p>
<h2>No Trigger</h2>
<p>Yet another band I discovered via Till The Wheels. It's almost surprising that I wasn't aware of these guys as they have been going for a few years and are somewhat more established than the artists I usually see. They play unapologetic pop-punk and I've gotten somewhat obsessed with their new release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRBIJ_6msjM"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/tRBIJ_6msjM/0.jpg" alt="No Trigger - Antifantasy"></a></p>
<h2>Chaos Reigns</h2>
<p>I was doing research for where to record some hardcore songs for an upcoming project and I ended up at the website for <a href="http://www.monolithstudioslondon.com/">Monolith Studios</a>, who claim to be &quot;London's heaviest recording studio&quot;. Checking out their references I found a bunch of bands I enjoyed the sound of, of which <em>Chaos Reigns</em> was one. Coincidentally they were playing a show a few weeks later so I decided to stop by and check them out properly. The show was absolutely amazing and I got to know some of the members in the band, so now I try to see them whenever they play. Their style is very technical hardcore/metal songs that are somewhat reminiscent of <em>Every Time I Die</em> or <em>Protest The Hero</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eatMM3YiDMk"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/eatMM3YiDMk/0.jpg" alt="Chaos Reigns - Big Beat Manifesto"></a></p>
<h2>Soul Glo</h2>
<p>I went to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0H3RlaQVrM"><em>Coheed and Cambria</em></a>, one of my favourite bands, for the 7th time and <em>Soul Glo</em> opened for them. They play really chaotic and screamy hardcore and I felt it was a bit of a strange combination with Coheed's style of music. I remember mentioning to a guy I had met at that show that I would love to see them play a smaller venue... which is exactly what they did about 3 weeks later. So I went to see them at the smaller venue and it was an absolutely wild show; exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IaAs4D14kw"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/0IaAs4D14kw/0.jpg" alt="Soul Glo - Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass?)"></a></p>
<h2>Buds.</h2>
<p>I was at a day festival a friend of mine was playing at and it was clear that I was at the wrong show. Most of the music wasn't interesting at all and I was not having the best time... until <em>Buds.</em> played their set. Live their music has a more melodic hardcore feel to it, but I can imagine someone listening to their studio recordings and calling it &quot;aggressive indie rock&quot; or something. They're lovely people and I've seen them 3 times now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhz_oExCfus"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mhz_oExCfus/0.jpg" alt="Buds. - Medicinal Cathedral"></a></p>
<h2>The Callous Daoboys</h2>
<p>When I went to see <em>Coheed and Cambria</em> (the same show I discovered <em>Soul Glo</em> at) I met <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bearfeetnath/">a guy</a> in the queue who I ended up hanging out with. He recommended that I check out <em>The Callous Daoboys</em>, a mathcore band from the US who he was currently obsessed with. It's clear that we share music taste because I gave them a listen and they were amazing. He and I ended up meeting up again when they came to London later in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feRMvnP-rj8"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/feRMvnP-rj8/0.jpg" alt="The Callous Daoboys - Waco Jesus"></a></p>
<h2>The End</h2>
<p>Those were my highlights for 2023. It was an intense year with a lot of travelling to and from venues, so the plan is to slow things down this year. Even though I have tickets to a festival next week, and am going back to Norway for a show the week after, I am not going to keep track of the artists I see anymore. I got a little too focused on seeing as many shows as possible to get the number up and I need to focus on my own music. I did end up recording at Monolith Studios and I have four songs which will be released at some point in 2024.</p>
